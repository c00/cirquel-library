# Cirque Library

The online lightweight variant of Cirquel. This will soon replace the normal website of cirquelapp.com.

## Build for Server side rendering (Angular Universal)

0. Install pubsy: `npm i -g pubsy`
1. run `pubsy build`
2. Restart forever... (MANUAL STEP BUT I'M LAZY SO HAVEN'T AUTOMATED IT YET. WHY IS MY SHIFT BUTTON STUCK?!)

Note on automated deployments: Currently we create the symlinks before running npm install... That's kinda shitty.

## Todo on full site 

Figure out how to keep static assets working (Probably some nginx setting)
- AU, PP and apple site forwarding nonsense
Make recent thingy
Make post about t-shirts

Restart nginx, test settings on library
